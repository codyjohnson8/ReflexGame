# ReflexGame
This Arduino Reflex Game challenges players to complete simple tasks displayed on the serial monitor within a specified time limit. Failure to complete the task in time results in a loss. As you progress through the rounds, the difficulty increases as the allotted time to respond decreases. 

To begin the game, press either the left or right button. The monitor will then prompt you with one of three commands: "tap it," "cover it," or "sing it," each requiring a specific action on the Arduino. Successfully completing each task earns you a point, but also reduces the time you have to respond in subsequent rounds.

The game continues until you successfully complete 30 rounds, at which point you win. Good luck!

Inputs: The inputs for this game include the left and right buttons, the tap interrupt sensor, the light intake sensor, and the sound intake sensor.
Outputs: The outputs for this game include the pixles lighting up, and sound produced.
